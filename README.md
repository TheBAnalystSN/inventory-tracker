# Inventory Tracker – TypeScript SBA

This project is an Inventory Tracker built using **TypeScript**, focusing on classes, inheritance, modules, and structuring an application using clean folder organization. It demonstrates how to manage product types, apply tax rules, and display product information using TypeScript OOP concepts.

## Project Structure & How Bryan Santos Helped Me

One of the biggest challenges I had was organizing my folders correctly so TypeScript could recognize my imports and exports. **Bryan Santos helped me fix my folder structure**, and once I followed his guidance, my modules began working without errors.

Here is the final folder structure:
inventory-tracker/
│── package.json
│── tsconfig.json
│── dist/ (compiled JavaScript output)
└── src/
├── app.ts
└── models/
├── Product.ts
├── PhysicalProduct.ts
├── DigitalProduct.ts

Organizing the project this way helped avoid TypeScript module resolution issues and made the code easier to maintain.

## 📘 What the Inventory Tracker Does

The Inventory Tracker demonstrates:

- Creating multiple product classes with TypeScript  
- Using inheritance to extend base classes  
- Applying tax rules differently for physical and digital products  
- Displaying fully formatted product details  
- Structuring code using TypeScript modules  
- Compiling TS → JS using a TypeScript configuration file  
- Running the project through Node after compilation

Sources I Used

While completing this assignment, I used the following resources for guidance:

W3Schools – for reviewing JavaScript fundamentals

TypeScript Classes Documentation – to understand constructors, inheritance, and access modifiers

MDN Web Docs (Mozilla Developer Network) – for deeper explanations of related JavaScript behavior

Help from Bryan Santos, especially for correcting my folder structure

These sources helped me better understand object-oriented programming in TypeScript and how modules should be organized.
